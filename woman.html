  <h2>Female Workforce Statistics</h2>

  <div class="iframe-container">

      loading="lazy"></iframe>

    <section>
      <h3>Global Trends</h3>
      <p>Approximately half of all women worldwide participate in the labor force. However, this varies significantly
        across regions. Most regions have female labor force participation rates slightly or clearly above the global
        average. The Middle East and North Africa and South Asia have much lower participation rates. Men tend to
        participate in labor markets more frequently than women, with variations across societies. The female-to-male
        ratio in labor force participation rates shows that women’s participation tends to be lower than that of men in
        most countries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Regional Variation</h3>
      <p>In five of the seven regions, more than half of women (ages 15-64) participate in the labor market. However, in
        South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, only a quarter or less of women participate. Male participation
        rates are roughly the same (around 80 percent) and notably higher than that of females globally.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Income Levels and Participation</h3>
      <p>Female labor force participation is highest in some of the poorest and richest countries. It is lowest in
        countries with average national incomes somewhere in between. The relationship between female participation
        rates
        and GDP per capita follows a U-shape: highest in the poorest and richest countries, lower in middle-income
        countries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Specific Examples</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn’s sample across 163 countries shows that women account for 41.9% of the workforce. India, a populous
        country in the lower-middle income group, has a 57 percentage point gap between male and female labor force
        participation. Rising female labor force participation has been a remarkable economic development over the last
        century.</p>
