# BeyondOrdinary - TechXlerate Spring 2024 Hackathon

### Inspiration
As students passionate about STEM, we've seen firsthand the lack of representation and support for women in our fields. Inspired to make a difference, we embarked on creating BeyondOrdinary, a platform dedicated to empowering and championing diversity. This is a more advance remake of our previous project called STEM Forums.

### What it does
At BeyondOrdinary, women can explore a platform showcasing women's achievements and timelines illustrating their successes. They can interact with a chatbot for website assistance, enroll in courses with quizzes, reach out with inquiries, read success story blogs, discover job opportunities tailored for women, and much more!

### Future Plans
**If we update the website**, we plan to integrate a backend system to streamline user sign-ups, course enrollment, and progress tracking. Our goal is to incorporate various animations, including loading animations, to enhance the website's visual appeal. Additionally, we aim to integrate APIs for job listings and a chatbot, thereby improving the platform's utility for our users. We also have plans to introduce a forum where users from around the world can contribute. Many of these future features will rely on a robust database, so we will be exploring database solutions as well.
