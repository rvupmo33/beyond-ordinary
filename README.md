# TechXlerate Spring 2024 Hackathon

## Description

### Inspiration
As students passionate about STEM, we've seen firsthand the lack of representation and support for women and non-binary individuals in our fields. Inspired to make a difference, we embarked on creating STEM Forums, a platform dedicated to empowering and championing diversity in STEM.

### What it does
At BeyondOrdinary, women can explore a platform showcasing women's achievements, and timelines illustrating their successes, interact with a chatbot for website assistance, enroll in courses with quizzes, reach out for inquiries, read success story blogs, discover job opportunities tailored for women, and much more!
